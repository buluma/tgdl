# Container entrypoint:
#   1. Fix ownership + permissions on the bind-mounted /app/data so the
#      `node` user (uid 1000) can always read/write — host-side perms
#      from `docker run -v ./data:/app/data` otherwise win and locked
#      out new installs on Linux hosts.
#   2. Drop privileges to `node` via gosu and exec the CMD.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run on every container start. The chown/chmod walk
# is a no-op once perms are already correct (millisecond-cost on most
# volumes; if you have millions of files set FAST_BOOT=1 to skip it).
